CS PhD Student @ [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/)

Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), advised by [Prof. Rachee Singh](https://www.racheesingh.com/).
My research interests are broadly in machine learning systems and AI infrastructure.

Previously, I worked at [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/), where I conducted research on systems for ML and large-scale data processing, and developed an ML-as-a-Service platform on GPU infrastructure.
I earned my M.S. in [Computer Science](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/).
I received my B.S. in [Computer Science & Engineering](http://ecs.sogang.ac.kr/) from [Sogang University](https://www.sogang.ac.kr/en) with *Summa Cum Laude*.
