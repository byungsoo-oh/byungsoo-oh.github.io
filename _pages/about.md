CS PhD Student @ [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/)

Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), advised by [Prof. Rachee Singh](https://www.racheesingh.com/). My research interests are in improving machine learning systems and cloud computing in terms of performance, resource-efficiency, and usability.

Previously, I worked at [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/) for 4.5 years, where I conducted research on accelerating systems for ML training.
I also developed and operated an ML cloud system built on a large-scale GPU infrastructure.
Prior to that, I earned my M.S. in [Computer Science](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). I received my B.S. in [Computer Science & Engineering](https://cs.sogang.ac.kr/) from [Sogang University](https://wwwe.sogang.ac.kr/) with *Summa Cum Laude*.
